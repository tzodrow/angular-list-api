# Angular List API

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.2.4. (This will need to be installed for any 'ng' commands below)

Requires install of [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) or [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which includes npm)

Optionally install [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) to run any 'ng' commands below.

## Development server

run 'npm install' to install any missing dependencies.

Run 'npm start' which will execute 'ng serve -o' without having Angular CLI installed. The '-o' will automatically open default browswer but you can also navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

OR

Run `ng serve [-o]` for the same result (requires Angular CLI). Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.
